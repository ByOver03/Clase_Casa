#Develop a program to manage a list of employees. Each employee will be represented as a dictionary with the following fields:
#name, positions (a tuple with several roles), and salary
# Implement options to:
#   Add a new employee
#   Calculate the average salary
#   Search employees by specific position
# Handle exceptions for:
#   Invalid input when adding an employee
#   Attempting to search for nonexistent position
#
